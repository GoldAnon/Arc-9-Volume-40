*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

Aldebaran: [――Expand Territory, matrix redefinition.]

Dealing with alterations in the situation, second by second, moment by moment, instant by instant, he advanced the world.

For Aldebaran’s Authority, incapable of turning the clock back on a grand scale, this was a gamble that reeled his victory in steadily, but simultaneously posed the risk of definitively relinquishing his victory.

Aldebaran: [――Expand Territory, matrix redefinition.]

Step by step, move by move, action by action, he verified, defined, and closed in on the board.

The way top class warriors would constantly continue to advance like this, piling up experience in a world of ceaseless bouts all decided in a single move, he really could not imagine it.

Aldebaran: [――Expand Territory, matrix redefinition.]

And that was not limited to just warriors; top class intellectuals were the same in the sense of their ability to think in a different dimension.

Rather, since they were not directly involved in practice, they would go without knowing the true fragrance of blood and the pain of wounds, merely constructing the progression of the world within their heads, so there might have been more of a monstrous sense to them.

In any case――,

Aldebaran: [――Expand Territory, matrix redefinition.]

Trampling on the discipline of warriors and the deliberations of intellectuals alike, disregarding the logic of being unable to ascertain the results of two different choices simultaneously, even in a battle to be decided in a single blow, Aldebaran merely snatched victory away; they had the right to curse, loathe, and scorn his way of being as contemptible.

Let those vilifications of theirs cut into him as much as they liked. In exchange――,

Aldebaran: [――Expand Territory, matrix redefinition.]

With this dirty method, he would absolutely seize victory.

???: […At this point, I bet you’re hoping for as much amiability as a pig wanting to be fed.]

Wringing out a low, groaning voice, the pig-faced man―― the joke of the King Pig, Doltero Amule,  when compared to his previous dignified ones that had induced a sense of despair, this one was husky. 

That was only natural. His entire body was covered in lacerations from steel threads, and he was losing copious amounts of blood from his innumerable wounds. Rather, the fact that he was still conscious, and that his face wore no grievous expression, was far more strange.

Aldebaran: [Having come this far, I know that you’re not afraid of dying. But, even if you don’t fear death, pain should still be painful, yeah?]

Doltero: [You don’t understand even when saying it yourself? Both death and pain are ultimately things that make us afraid. Then, all we gotta do is swallow that fear.]

Aldebaran: […I can’t understand you.]

Doltero’s point was that the fear induced by death and the fear induced by pain were one in the same. But, how Aldebaran saw it, those were different things. The fear borne of death, and the fear borne of pain, were different. 

To take it further, since pain was a stimulus to the body, it seemed rather distinct from fear.

Doltero: [――. Whatever you say, it’s the backbiting of a pig.]

Before Aldebaran, white froth emerged in the corners of Doltero’s mouth as he muttered thus.

Around the thick neck of the King Pig, several tens of fine steel wires were wound, applying pressure to his trachea. Doltero had resisted that strangling by slipping two fingers in, but those fingers sunk into his neck and lost their function, and with blood no longer circulating to his brain, his large body finally fell to its knees.

Having fallen to his knees, Doltero was surrounded by the fifty-five collapsed subordinates who had accompanied him.

While taking on this King Pig, he had taken down the other men one by one, an effort that had literally broken his bones, cleaved off his flesh, and robbed him of his life numerous times. ――In total, twenty-three thousand and eight times.

With this many attempts, this was among the top class of Aldebaran’s veteran history of losing battles.

Of course, one contributing factor was that the organized attacks of the King Pig and his underlings of the Black Silver Coin were exceedingly thorough, but the primary cause was Aldebaran’s own lack of talent.

The steel thread entangled around Doltero’s neck was not one that extended out from Yae’s hand, but from the hand of Aldebaran, who had borrowed one of her rings.

Manipulating a steel thread with a single finger, he closed in on Doltero’s fierce attack one move at a time and affixed a thread to his neck, tying it around to apply as much pressure as he could to that thick neck. ――Amidst this harsh Territory, learning the Steel Thread Technique from square one until it was viable for him had required over twenty thousand attempts. 

Doltero: [――――]

Boom, sounded the fist as it vigorously slammed into the ground, Doltero falling completely unconscious.

Even still, the body of the King Pig, who reigned over the criminal underworld, did not topple over sideways, but instead his large body was supported by his own fist that had pressed into the ground, a demonstration of his dignity; unbowed, unbent, unbroken.

In spite of being his enemy, he could not help but commend that posture.

Yae: [Haah~, you’re outrageous, Al-sama. I was proud that no~body in the village except me had been able to learn it, but isn’t this now a disgrace~?]

And, beside Aldebaran as he stood out of breath before the silenced Doltero, Yae, having strung every last adversary aside from Doltero in the air, spoke so.

Her eyes, narrowed like a cat, observed Aldebaran’s Steel Thread Technique that had tied up Doltero. Be that as it may, it was impossible for him to easily accept that praise.

Aldebaran: [Don’t be ridiculous. With just a single finger, all the muscles from the top of my head to the tips of my toes are on the verge of cramping. Doing ten times that with ten fingers, are you actually super muscular despite looking so thin?]

Yae: [Eh~, are you taking an interest in what’s under my uniform, Al-sama~? I’ve given you so many chances to check for yourself, and yet you were always so mean as to turn me down.]

Aldebaran: […The ring, let me borrow it for just a little longer.]

Responding to Yae as she mischievously poked fun at him, Aldebaran stroked the ring fitted on the ring finger of his right hand. He had tested it on each finger, but it felt the most intuitive on Aldebaran’s ring finger.

In all honesty, he had been reluctant to put a ring on his ring finger, but he did not have a left hand to begin with. It was nonsensical to bring such emotional obstinancies of a little girl onto a battlefield.

In any case――,

Aldebaran: [Old man, you alright? I didn’t have much leeway to pay attention your way, my bad.]

Heinkel: [N-no, that’s fine. That’s… alright.]

As Aldebaran checked on his well-being, Heinkel choked on his words as he nodded.

During the battle with Doltero, Heinkel, to put it bluntly, had fallen into a useless state of malfunction, but after Yae tied up the men, he contributed by knocking them unconscious, and by breaking the Conversation Mirror of the mirror-bearer, so Aldebaran would acknowledge that he had done his job.

As expected, against a certain level of powerful individuals―― Doltero was a given, but it would be difficult to count Heinkel among their fighting strength when it came time to clash with those in the same ballpark as Gaston. Aldebaran had no intention of reproaching Heinkel, who harbored such a mental fragility.

Everyone had an opponent whom their soul would absolutely refuse to face.

For Yae, that was Aldebaran, and for Aldebaran, that was―― it mattered not.

Heinkel: […Aldebaran, you, what’s really the deal with you?]

Aldebaran: [Hm?]

Heinkel: [You, had absolutely no chance of defeating that pig human. He was someone who utterly exceeded you in both skill and power. And yet, you were the one who won in the end. And mostly unharmed at that, overwhelmingly so.]

Aldebaran: [――――]

With eyes as if he was beholding someone truly august, Heinkel spoke so to Aldebaran.

Listening to Heinkel’s words, Aldebaran revised his evaluation of him to that of a man who was quite observant.

Perhaps precisely because he had been watching as an onlooker, Aldebaran’s irregularity had left more of an impression.

Neither was it that Aldebaran had grown strong, nor was it that he was a strong match against Doltero. If it must be said, it would have appeared as if he had won by piling up a hundred lucky shots.

Yae: [――He’s a monster.]

Hence, plainly declaring so, and not asking for anything more, Yae’s attitude was rather pleasant.

Answering Heinkel in Aldebaran’s stead, her face bore no semblance of fear or awe. After all, Yae’s impression of Aldebaran had already been completed. 

Yae: [Al-sama, is a monster. We’re working together with a monster, y’know?]

Heinkel: […I know many people who’re like monsters. But, this guy’s…]

Yae: [There’s a difference between those who are like monsters and actual monsters. Please don’t talk about such shams~.]

Her speech was gentle, her expression a smile; however, her phrasing was neither a confirmation nor a denial.

Overpowered by the calm yet threatening demeanor Yae showed on the surface, Heinkel was at a loss for words.

Aldebaran: [Regardless of whether I’m a monster or not, we’ll proceed from here just as planned. Yae will suppress the opponent’s numbers, and I’ll deal with the strong ones. Old man, I’m counting on you to follow my directions, and deal with the mirrors.]

Heinkel: [Y-yeah, got it.]

Yae: [Roger ro~ger. As you command, Al-sama~.]

Next to Heinkel as he timidly nodded, Yae lifted her arms in a hurrah, and with a fine movement of her fingertips she controlled her steel threads. Guided by her fingers, the steel threads coiled around the fainted Doltero, binding the limbs of the King Pig that had demonstrated his obstinacy to not collapse, stringing him up in the air with the others.

Even if he understood that it was a safety measure in case Doltero woke up, it did not feel good. That went not only for Doltero, but for Rachins too, who had needed to be beaten to the point of fainting.

Aldebaran: [My head hurts…]

Frankly, he had underestimated Felt’s faction.

Outside of Reinhard, he had thought them all to be non-combatants excluding Ezzo. Still, the old giant, Grassis and Gaston, and the main target of Felt were waiting for him――,

Yae: [If you would just remove that single shackle, Al-sama, I would be way more effective, y’know?]

Aldebaran: [――――]

Yae: [This goes without saying, but… rather than tying them up, I’m better at strangling people to death, this little ol’ me.]

Every so often, for various reasons Yae would speak words to tempt Aldebaran, but even more so than when those whispers tried to lure him to the bedroom, these struck Aldebaran’s eardrums in a much more alluring manner.

Unlike Heinkel, who was unable to demonstrate his true strength for emotional reasons, the reason why Yae could not show her true worth was none other than because she was abiding by Aldebaran’s ego.

If he lifted that restriction, the forest abundant in cover would instantly become Yae’s hunting ground. ――Even if the opponent was five hundred strong, it would not take much time until the green leaves would all be stained with blood.

Only, it was not that Yae was muttering in discontent for being unable to do that.

After all, no matter how bereft of legitimacy those directions were, it was her nature to follow orders.

Hence, the reason she was whispering to Aldebaran like this was――,

Aldebaran: [――Thank you. But it’s none of your concern.]

Yae: [Oh my.]

Sticking her tongue out with a “Behhh”, Yae was unsurprised that her proposal had been rejected.

From the start, it was a proposal she had no expectation of being accepted. Surprisingly―― no, it was not surprising for she who wished for Aldebaran to accomplish his goal, but it seemed to have set him alight with motivation.

Thanks to that sweet, tempting complaint, Aldebaran regained his exhausted willpower.

Aldebaran: [We also have the option to continue through the forest and slip through the south, but that’s a no-go when considering what’s to follow. Unfortunately for them, we’ll be having lil’ miss Felt and her crew be defeated here.]

Yae: [Understood. Then, proceed as planned?]

The atmosphere from the preceding conversation vanished, and Aldebaran nodded at Yae as she inclined her head.

Then, thinking of Felt and the old giant who were likely working out a plan to secure victory on the other side of the forest, he quietly muttered.

Aldebaran: [You guys are strong. It’s just―― your stars were bad.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――Witnessing that the third Conversation Mirror had been broken, Rom-jii became convinced.

Rom: [As I thought, you’re doin’ more than just seein’ through our plans.]

He removed and threw away one of the Conversation Mirrors fitted into his gauntlets; having lost its counterpart, it no longer was of any use. Rom-jii considered the helmet bastard’s optimal conduct―― immediately finding out the mirror-bearer, ordained with a Conversation Mirror, an action whose essence was to disrupt the flow of information.

Rachins had fallen, and even Doltero, who had rushed to the scene, had been utterly defeated.

Although he had estimated it to be a possible outcome, Rom-jii could not hold back his surprise at the defeat of the King Pig, having known the latter for quite a long time.

Rom: [If he’d been born a mere ten years earlier, his name probably would’ve gone down in the history books tellin’ of the Demi-Human War.]

The person in question would have likely laughed at that statement and brushed it off as an exaggeration, but in Rom-jii’s mind, it was a fair assessment.

But then again, the Demi-Human War had not been such a close affair that Doltero alone would have been able to make the difference between victory and defeat. Even if his name would have been recorded in the history books, he most likely would have been among the many who had lost their lives at the hands of the Sword Demon or that generation’s Sword Saint.

Either way, Doltero had been defeated. Did that mean the opponent was on the same level as the Sword Demon?

Rom: [Nah, that ain’t it.]

Shaking his thick head from side-to-side, Rom-jii discarded his pessimistic thoughts.

In truth, the existence of the Sword Demon was something of a trauma for Rom-jii. Against the lone Sword Demon, even if Rom-jii commanded a force a thousand strong, he would glimpse no sign of victory whatsoever.

This was not to say that the Sword Demon was the strongest in the world, but rather that his renown made him seem that way.

There were indeed those proprietors of renown such that their opponents would be made to feel that victory was unattainable, even if that was not truly the case.

Even Felt being able to compete head-to-head against the big shots of the criminal underworld was unlikely, both in terms of physical strength and intelligence. Nonetheless, they still looked up to her as their queen.

That, was the unshakeable quality known as “renown”. ――Something the helmet bastard did not possess.

To put it simply, he did not inspire fear. That it contributed to the unknowns of his character could be said, however.

Rom: [Well then, we just hafta crush those unknowns one-by-one. ――Launch it up!]

Following the orders called out by Rom-jii, the fighters left on hand, numbering around twenty, began to move.

Fire Magic Ore ignited, and launched were the contents of the Magic Cannons―― the latter were valuable items that could be carried by hand and used continuously if cooled, however, the Magic Stones they had fired were even more valuable.

They were――,

Rom: [――Night Banishers.]

Immediately after, white lightsa white light sliced across the sky of the battlefield like a bolt of lightning, instantly clearing away the clouds. The glow of the blue sky peering out chased away the approaching dusk, rewriting time. ――No, that was not the case. The effect of the Night Banisher was merely a reproduction of daytime.

If launched at night, it would overwrite the darkness, giving the appearance of a daytime sky. It was even possible to create an inexplicable phenomenon in which raindrops would fall from a clear sky if one were to be recreated on a rainy day.

Originally, the effect of the Night Banisher was to drive away the night that caused chaos on the battlefield, but this Magic Stone had another effect that most were unaware of.

To rewrite an overcast day into a sunny one, to turn night into day, was the effect of painting reality over with an illusion.

That was to say――,

Rom: [――If he’s been watchin’ us from the sky, then he can’t rely on that view no more.]

As the battle dragged on, the Night Banishing Magic Stones that had been prepared for the blackness came into play.

Judging this to be a rare stroke of good fortune, Rom-jii took steps to seal off one of the possible explanations behind the helmet bastard’s actions―― an eye in the heavens that may have been surveilling them.

But then again――,

???: [Unit Six reporting, we found the helmet bastard! We’re going to… WOAHHH!?]

From the report of the mirror-bearer assigned to Unit Six, and his subsequent sudden disappearance, the helmet bastard had broken a fourth Conversation Mirror, and as such Rom-jii held confidence that the possibility of an eye in the heavens had vanished.

However, he was not discouraged. In the first place, the likelihood of an eye in the heavens had been low.

In response to the optimal conduct of the helmet bastard, the first instructions given by Rom-jii were for the mirror-bearers of each unit to alternate at regular intervals, and to report the next movements in writing through the mirror.

However, the helmet bastard responded to this by eliminating designated mirror-bearers right away twice in a row.

Even supposing he was able to observe their movements from the sky, he would not have been able to fully respond to every move.

In that case, what remained was――,

Rom: [It might be a Great Spirit I dunno ‘bout, or a powerful Divine Protection, or he might be seein’ inside his opponents’ minds, otherwise, perhaps it’s not minds that he’s seein’, but――]

And so, he listed each possibility that came to mind, and made plans to eliminate them one-by-one.

It was hard to imagine that the helmet bastard had a Great Spirit with him considering his actions. A Spirit’s true talent was magic, but the helmet bastard showed no signs of using a Spirit’s power to overcome oncoming challenges. Assistance from Spirits of the Yin and Yang attributes would not have been as noticeable as from Spirits of other attributes, but those Spirits were also of high rarity.

The possibility that one was accompanying him was not zero, but――,

Rom: [It’s of low priority. ――Unit Seven, go east; Unit Nine, proceed southeast. Hurry ta where Unit Six’s fightin’. Nevermind, there ain’t a need ta support Unit Six. Instead, let’s get yer two units workin’ together. Use both Magic Stones and throwing stones, we’ve gotta see if we can make him use two or more Divine Protections no matter what.]

By nature, a single person could only hold a single Divine Protection.

There had only been a handful of people in history holding multiple Divine Protections, and the number of people whose Divine Protections were both useful could be counted on one hand. ――It was odd that among those individuals abnormally blessed by fortune, the likes of the Sword Saint and the Mad Prince both existed in this current day and age, but there was a possibility that the helmet bastard could be a third one, to be added to those ranks.

Henceforth――,

Rom: [You can ascertain someone’s Divine Protection by bundlin’, stackin’ up hardships ‘n watchin’ how they handle them. ――It ain’t for nothin’ that I’ve been called the one who’s killed the most Divine Protection holders in the world.]

△▼△▼△▼△

From the sudden deployment of the Night Banisher onward, Aldebaran sensed that the situation had worsened dramatically.

With the movements of the opposition clearly being laced with contrived inaction, even merely identifying the mirror-bearer had become increasingly difficult, ramping up his number of attempts up by an order of magnitude.

Aldebaran: [Because they keep shuffling around the role of mirror-bearer, if the timing of initiating the confrontation is even slightly off, a completely different guy’ll have the mirror…!]

Moreover, in place of straightforward attacks that aimed at simply suppressing, defeating, or killing Aldebaran and his allies, there was a marked increase in attacks that seemed to be aimed at testing their reactions. Setting aside those underlying intentions, Aldebaran was tormented by having to deal with such offensives that did not directly threaten his life.

Were they attacks of lethal nature, assured to rob him of his life, he could crush them without mercy, unhesitatingly taking measures to stifle them at their inception. However, since that intent was nebulous, and since its impact was minimal to the extent of clearing a pebble off the roadside, the conduct required of him was overwhelmingly extensive.

Aldebaran: [Taken to an extreme, even a single scratch becomes a question of whether to start over.]

Having said that, he still could not ignore attacks that, akin to a slow-acting poison, would force him into a softlock by merely having received them. As a result, once that uncertainty took root in him, Aldebaran had no choice but to deal with each and every attack, ramping up the number of attempts by yet another order of magnitude.

Aldebaran: [You’re getting on my nerves, shitty old geezer.]

△▼△▼△▼△

As the number of mirrors being shattered continued to accumulate, Rom-jii grew increasingly wary of how the situation had been progressing. 

Thanks to prior directives from the heads of their respective organizations, the ruffians of the criminal underworld followed Rom-jii’s instructions with surprising obedience. Given the situation, some of them likely fell without even understanding what their role had been, and yet fallen they had, with nary a word of complaint; such an attitude was indeed admirable.

Owing to that, the number of cards in his hand were dwindling at an alarming rate, but in return, the face of the card kept concealed by the opposition was slowly but surely being revealed.

Rom: [They’re a resolute bunch indeed. Felt might’ve built the relationship with Flanders, but the heavens still fervently keep watch over those who struggle.]

The effect of the Night Banisher obstructed any eyes in the heavens, and by stacking wave upon wave of Magic Stone attacks to alter the Mana concentration, the area was rendered intoxicating to Spirits, which thus confirmed the absence of any cooperating Spirits. Suspecting a highly versatile Divine Protection, through a combination of short and long ranged attacks, both physical and magical, the Divine Protections of which he was aware―― it was limited to the ones whose efficiency had been ascertained by using Reinhard as a test subject, but by targeting the characteristics of Divine Protections in his knowledge, ninety percent of the potential candidates for the current scenario had been eliminated.

Rom: [This ain’t the Divine Protection of First Sight or the Divine Protection of the Second Coming. So if it’s neither the Divine Protection of Stormy Skies nor the Divine Protection of the Tiger’s Den, not many candidates remain.]

The remaining ten percent could possibly serve as one-trick ponies, depending on how they were used, but they lacked the versatility to deal with a situation as dire as this. With that, nearly all the candidates were dropped, relegated to the back of his mind.

From here on out, he would move on to the stage of suspecting something that was neither magic, nor Spirit, nor Divine Protection―― an Authority.

Rom: [Bending the laws of reality itself, wouldn't that be pride beyond the station of man, helmet bastard?]

△▼△▼△▼△

When the tide of the wave attacks shifted, and the opposition’s movements took a turn, Aldebaran ground his teeth, sensing that the worst possibility that came to mind had been right on the mark.

In all likelihood, that old giant―― Valga Cromwell, had an inkling that Aldebaran was using an Authority, overcoming these imminent critical situations by stacking up a countless Matrix.

The succession of wave attacks, and the sequence of numerous attacks rich in variety that kept up for a while, had been meant to whittle down the possibilities of how Aldebaran was escaping from such an overwhelming disadvantage.

Near infinite trial and error by means of redefining a Matrix and the existence of a Territory―― it was likely impossible that they had grasped that to be the true nature of Aldebaran’s Authority, but he had a keen feeling that it had been narrowed down to something quite close.

The chief possibilities of magic or a Divine Protection had already been eliminated through an exhaustive investigation, and he got a sense that they had entered the stage where a tremendous, absurd Authority was starting to be suspected. Similar to Ezzo Cadner back at the Pleiades Watchtower, there was a high possibility that clever individuals would see through Aldebaran’s Authority.

But then again, it would be difficult to corner Aldebaran even if one had seen through it. Ezzo’s judgement to flood the escape path with Water Magic had been optimal in a certain sense, but it would have been a herculean task to accomplish a similar feat in a space this expansive.

Even so, the nasty premonition that tinged his heart did not disappear, causing Aldebaran to hesitate about updating his Matrix in such a short timespan; the difficulty of recovering from a single failure was steadily ramping up, little by little.

To begin with, why was the notorious Valga Cromwell from the Demi-Human War still alive, and serving Felt at that? Was Valga not the Great Strategist who harbored an immense hatred of humans, taking the lives of several thousands with his merciless stratagems in the Demi-Human War? His head was on the verge of seething as it blurted out complaints towards the incomprehensible combination. There’s something wrong with this, seriously.

△▼△▼△▼△

Having come this far, he had come to a point where there was no longer any room to doubt the worst possible premonition; as Rom-jii endured that bad feeling in his chest, he vigorously stroked his own bald head for no reason. 

Likely, the helmet bastard was using an Authority―― neither a Divine Protection nor magic, but an extraordinary power said to have once been used by the Witches, a power capable of bending the laws of the world; he was convinced. In the past, during the era of the Demi-Human War, when he had been acquainted with the successor to a Witch, Sphinx, she had said that she was a failed creation who had been unable to reproduce an Authority. However, though he had said he wanted achievements for Felt, with the enemy possessing an ability that had been desired so desperately by that Witch, this was far too troublesome an opponent.

And though he was loath to admit it, he had narrowed down the helmet bastard’s Authority to one of either “Reading the Thoughts of an Opponent” or “Seeing into the Short-Term Future”. However, at the current point, Rom-jii surmised that precognition had a higher probability than mind reading.

Since he had continued to evade this side’s attacks to this much of an extent, even supposing he was reading the mind of another, Rom-jii thought it would undoubtedly be that of his own, and had thus deployed the measures to ascertain if that was the case. 

He had given unique orders to two different units; the first unit he commanded to pass them by without attacking, and the second he ordered to launch an all out offensive, but the helmet bastard had gone to deal with the unit it would have been fine to ignore, plunging himself into the predicament of a pincer attack in between the first and second units. If he had read Rom-jii’s mind, or the mind of somebody in that first unit, then the helmet bastard would have just burdened himself with needless hardship.

At that moment, he ascertained that the helmet bastard’s Authority was not that of mind reading. That was to say, the true nature of the helmet bastard’s Authority was now mostly narrowed down to precognition.

Even if it had been narrowed down, he likely could not cheer out an “I did it!” with this conclusion. Sphinx had triumphantly spoken of them as powers that twisted the laws of reality, but something like “Precognition” was going too far.

Just how am I supposed to deal with something like that? There’s something wrong with this, seriously.

△▼△▼△▼△

???: [――Anyone who can’t use the “Flow Method”, get back! But don’t stop moving!!]

With a deep, booming voice, Gaston roared the command before bursting out from the group, charging straight at the helmeted bastard with a punch.

Gaston had already heard Rom-jii’s theory through the mirror relay. ――Apparently, that bastard could see just a little ahead into the future.

Gaston: [Then all I gotta do is make sure knowing doesn’t mean shit!]

Bellowing like thunder, Gaston abandoned the idea of landing a single, heavy blow. Instead, he switched to a relentless flurry of strikes, aiming to cut off the bastard’s escape routes and land a hit no matter what.

But in response, the helmet bastard stomped the ground hard,

Helmet Bastard: [Smart thinking, Gaston. But this time, thinking was the wrong move.]

The earth swelled into a protective wall, absorbing the attacks and protecting the helmet bastard. He gritted his teeth, just like the bastard said, his plan had backfired. And before he could react, the helmet bastard turned the very same earth into gauntlets around his arms and smashed Gaston in the forehead. Gaston reeled back, head snapping backward.

And then, Gaston noticed that the helmet bastard was coming in for the finishing blow.

Gaston: [Hraaah~!!]

Sensing the attack, Gaston twisted his massive frame midair, using the momentum of his backward lean to launch a sharp kick.

Spinning through the air, the nimble strike was a technique he had copied from Felt when she tried to slip away from Reinhard’s grasp, like a cat twisting out of a hold. No one expected a brute like Gaston to pull off something so acrobatic, not even the Old Man of the Astrea family who had taken the same hit in training――,

Gaston: [Gotcha. Four times, in fact.]

With those cryptic words, Gaston's kick had sliced through empty air.

An attack that Gaston had honed to the level of a finishing move had been rendered useless. But before he could even dwell on that frustration, a strange sensation seized his body.

It felt as though a giant hand had grabbed hold of him, his right leg yanked upward. ――Looking down, he saw it, a near-invisible thread, extending from the helmet bastard’s right hand, binding him in place.

Apparently, it was not just the red-haired maid, this helmet bastard could use it too.

Helmet Bastard: [Mine’s just a single strand, though. That one’s the real genius.] 

Hearing the helmet bastard’s lifeless tone as he spoke words of praise for his comrade, Gaston ground his teeth in frustration.

His right leg was suspended by the thread and raised all the way to head height. His left foot, barely touching the ground, was forced onto its toes and his body was left utterly powerless. In this ridiculous, helpless position, Gaston had been completely neutralized.

And with that, the helmet bastard turned his back on Gaston,

Helmet Bastard: [Old man, I’m leaving him to you. I’m going to back up Yae.]

With those words, the helmet bastard strode away as if Gaston were already dealt with.

Taking his place was the man Gaston had only heard about, Reinhard’s father. He had the same hair and eye color as Reinhard, yet everything about him felt completely different.

But more than anything, that expression, one that said he was only following the helmet bastard’s orders out of reluctance, pissed Gaston off.

Therefore――,

Reinhard's Father: [――Hk! You better not move recklessly or… bweh!]

Gaston struck the hardened face of his opponent and immediately lunged at the helmeted bastard’s turned back. But before his hand could reach him, his balance faltered, and the opponent, shifting to the side, easily evaded the charge, sending Gaston crashing hard onto the ground.

He had failed. ――Ripping himself free from the thread had been reckless, and now, his nearly torn ankle could not hold him up.

Reinhard's Father: [You, that leg…]

Gaston: [What's one damn leg supposed to mean!? I'm putting my life on the line here! You think this’s some game where I quit just 'cause it hurts a little!?]

Reinhard's Father: [――――]

Gaston: [But more than anything, what pisses me off is that you guys are only doing this out of reluctance. Don’t go picking fights with people if you can't even admire your own comrades' work!]

Gaston hurled his fury at the silent helmet bastard as he forced himself to his feet with every last ounce of strength.

Blood still poured from Gaston’s right ankle, the torn flesh exposing glimpses of white bone beneath. And yet, he clenched his teeth and stood, not because he felt no pain, but because of the weight of what he carried on his back.

Gaston had a woman he loved.

A woman who had trembled at the thought that the villain with the “Divine Dragon” might come, yet still held him close, telling him not to worry, before finally pushing him forward to go with Felt.

Gaston had men he admired.

Friends who grumbled endlessly yet always kept an eye on those around them. A lifelong companion who, despite his deep-seated cowardice, never truly ran away. A mentor who lectured at length but never hesitated to help, claiming that everyone had the right to achieve greatness. And a fated rival who loved a girl bold enough to make grand dreams reality, turning even a cursed past into strength.

Gaston had a man and a woman he looked up to.

A man so strong that he could protect anything he wished to safeguard.

A woman so radiant that, no matter where she was, forgetting her would be impossible.

――Gaston had every reason to stand tall and fight.

Gaston: [People like you, who don’t even have that, got no damn right stepping into a fight where others are giving it their all!!]

With a roar from the depths of his soul, Gaston charged at the helmet bastard once more, deliberately stepping forward with his right foot.

Even if that step shattered his leg, tore it apart, and left him unable to walk ever again, it did not matter. Even then, Gaston found something he could still do. Even then, he knew his comrades would never abandon him. ――Right now, all that mattered was beating the helmet bastard.

Pushing off the ground, Gaston's massive frame lifted into the air as he drove his left knee upward in a crushing strike. Even if it was blocked by a wall of earth, he had a follow-up ready, both arms raised high before hammering down in a two-stage assault.

Whichever it was, he had crushed the helmet hiding the helmet bastard’s face――,

Helmet Bastard: [――Honestly, that one got me.]

As if he had anticipated Gaston’s movements, the helmet bastard had already closed the distance at the exact moment of his takeoff.

Right after Gaston’s throat let out a faint groan, a fist, clad in a rock gauntlet, struck his face as he leaped into the air, causing his head to jerk backward.

Gaston: [Fuck you, you fuck…]

In the end, none of Gaston’s attacks had landed. Yet, whether it was a sarcastic joke or a bitter remark, it was not something that could be laughed at even for a second.

Along with the blood loss from his foot, Gaston’s consciousness swiftly faded――,

Gaston: [――Urrrghhh!!]

――And finally, along with a familiar high-pitched voice, Gaston saw a burst of white light at the edge of his vision.

△▼△▼△▼△

――That Meteor was named, the Star Rod.

It is said that most of the Meteors that existed in this world were created by a single Witch, driven by curiosity and craving, simply for her own amusement; the Star Rod however, was different.

The Witch had a goal, and the Rod was the crystallization of the knowledge she had painstakingly created to realize that goal―― and even though that goal was something as petty as silencing a quippy Dragon, it was genuinely powerful.

Siphoning Mana from its wielder and omitting the magic formula, the power that is unleashed becomes the starlight of Shario.

Of course, it was a light that was faint in comparison to Al Shario that could slay even Dragons, however, in the context of individual strength, given that its acquisition did not require any training, its power could still be described as extraordinary.

Pursued by the light of a star that would ceaselessly track its target until it struck, Aldebaran took every defensive measure he could think of, but none could withstand the assault while also avoiding injury. 

An attack of this type, that left no path for retreat, was Aldebaran’s nemesis. For that reason, in accordance with Aldebaran’s own list of priorities, only one viable option remained.

Aldebaran: [I’m sorry, old man.]

With that muttered apology, Aldebaran raised the ground and used it to thrust Heinkel, who had fallen on his bottom upon receiving a counterattack from Gaston, as a shield in between himself and the starlight.

Naturally, Heinkel had realized his intentions, and had begun to yell "Alde――" with anger evident upon his face, however, in the next instant, the burst of white light struck the red-haired swordsman, and his entire body was penetrated by the impact that could silence a Dragon.

Heinkel: [――Ahh, urgh, gaaaah!]

Aldebaran, who had first hand experience with it, had taken damage that felt like his brain and internal organs were being scorched. Heinkel however, albeit dropping to his knees with his eyes rolled back, still had the leeway to lay there writhing in agony.

In these brutal battles, both in Vollachia and presently alongside Aldebaran, being thoroughly proven time and again, was the extraordinary sturdiness that Heinkel possessed. ――Having been saved by the resilience that seemed to bring Heinkel himself no gratification whatsoever, Aldebaran looked to where the light had originated.

There――,

Aldebaran: [――So, you’re Camberley.]

Leaning against the glowing Star Rod with blood dripping from his nose, was a man of the Dwarf race. 

As of now, this battle had been reattempted twenty-nine thousand two hundred and twenty-one times since its inception. Consequently, Aldebaran understood the ruffians who had gathered here better than they did themselves.

Of the opponents he had encountered thus far, he knew every last one by name. In a way, it could be said that he had developed a sort of one-sided kinship with them. No, that would be a lie. He was fed up with facing such formidable opponents.

Regardless――,

Aldebaran: […Even if you’re aware of the activation method, it ain't a Meteor that an amateur can put to use. How the heck did you manage to activate it?]

Camberley: [How, do you think, I did it…? Heh, keep guessin’, for the rest, of your life.]

Aldebaran: [――. Don’t tell me, you used Hexcel?]

The sight of blood dripping from Camberley’s eyes and nose, as well as the bulging veins on his neck and forehead, had led Aldebaran to think of the adverse effects induced by the use of a certain illicit substance.

Going by the name Hexcel, it was an illicit drug produced using the Bokko fruit, which had the property of revitalizing the Mana within the body, as a raw ingredient, and its use was prohibited even in the Kingdom of Lugunica. ――Although the drug had a narcotic effect, it would, in essence, excessively generate Mana through the activation of the Gate.

Under the effect of that doping, even those unqualified could wield the Star Rod.

Aldebaran: [Even then, your insides will be ripped apart. Why go so far…?]

Camberley: [You think I alone can back down? When Rachins, and Gaston, and everyone else are giving it their all…even Reinhard, you know? Heh, I landed up with an amazing bunch…]

With his complexion deathly pale, not even bothering to wipe the bloody tears and bleeding nose that appeared starkly vivid by contrast, Camberley was in a state that could certainly be described as hopeless. 

However, spoken with the hint of a smile, his words lacked the recklessness that was typical of someone desperate.

Aldebaran: [Every single one of them…]

Behind Heinkel, who was writhing from being burnt by starlight, Gaston lay unconscious.

He was also one among those who, clashing with Aldebaran head-on, had wounded him more with words than fists. Of such, there were many in this battle against the Felt camp.

Only by defeating all of them, one by one, thoroughly and painstakingly, was Aldebaran able to arrive at this juncture.

After twenty-nine thousand two hundred and twenty-one times, by stacking attempt upon attempt――, 

Camberley: [――Helmet bastard, you haven’t fought with your life on the line, not even once, right?]

Aldebaran: [――――]

Camberley: [I have, you see. It’s this one right now… To fight with my life on the line, I have both a reason and the courage. That much, I have certainly proved…Hk.]

Stating thus with his trembling voice, Camberley tightened his grip upon the Star Rod he held, and once more, tried to invoke the light of a star.

However, that was an impossibility.

Camberley: [Gah!]

His Mana was insufficient to handle it. ――And as if to punish such a wielder, the Star Rod backfired, burning Camberley’s Gate and causing white smoke to spew from the entirety of his small body. 

If an unqualified person carries out the activation procedure, not only will it fail to be invoked, there would also be a small penalty. Installed by the Witch who had created the Star Rod, it was a safety valve to keep children from playing with it. The fact that the Witch believed this would serve as a safety valve, showed that she really did not understand the human heart.

Anyway, the safety valve did its job, and Camberley, rolling his eyes, fell backward――,

???: [Car-kun!]

At that moment, the girl who rushed over caught his small body before it hit the ground.

The woman, with dark skin and an alluring dress, was unmistakably the female boss of Flower Prison Garden from her features. She embraced the unconscious Camberley and directed her fierce gaze at Aldebaran.

Aldebaran: […You don’t need to glare at me like that. I don’t have the time or the interest to kick a dead body.]

Female Boss: [You all are…]

Aldebaran: [Seven days… no, it's already six days. There are only six days left before I plan to liven up the world. ――Though none of you believed me.]

The boss of Flower Prison Garden was called Toto. 

Although Doltero, the boss of Black Silver Coin, had tormented him relentlessly, the gaze of the woman, holding her precious man, was equally sharp and cutting.

At her gaze, Aldebaran had narrowed the eyes behind his helmet and had questioned Toto's fighting spirit with a simple, “Shall we?” Come to think of it, this had been the first time he had encountered a woman on that battlefield.

He had not even seen the faces of Grassis, who had delivered the first painful blow, or Felt, the representative.

Ignoring Aldebaran's thoughts, Toto tensed her limbs and shot a challenging look at him, as if urging him to move forward with a sharp motion of her chin.

A wry smile escaped Aldebaran at her bold attitude as he turned his back to her.

And then――,

Toto: [――Kuh, ah!]

Behind Aldebaran, Toto, who had dropped her raised iron fan, struggled to tear away the steel thread that had wrapped around her neck. Unable to do so, the sound of her falling reached his ears.

At that moment, Yae, who had approached the fallen Toto, picked up the iron fan that had dropped to the ground and said,

Yae: [Wow, there's poison in this. From the smell and color… it's probably jiramme? It's an instantly lethal poison, so looks like you were rea~lly eager to go all out.]

Aldebaran: [Don't get so angry.]

Yae: [It's rude to say I'm mad at you when you're being this ado~rable! First of all, it's Al-sama's fault, you know? Just because the opponent is a woman, you turn your back with a grin. I guess, for Al-sama, it might not matter how many times you die, but…]

Aldebaran: [――That was just the one time. It's ‘cause you came to help.]

It was not flattery, he truly had not been caught off guard even once by Toto.

Upon hearing Aldebaran's response, Yae fell silent with a “hmph” and wore a difficult expression. It had been Aldebaran's way of showing gratitude, but despite her complaints about how it was not enough when he actually expressed it, she reacted this way. It felt like his effort to say it was in vain.

Aldebaran: [Anyway, we've finished securing the area here… Now, what about the old man?]

Yae: [He's burned, but he's still alive and kicking. But don't you think he's a little off?]

Aldebaran: [Of course he's off. He's from the Astrea family.]

Yae: [Even someone like that is still an Astrea, huh?]

That said, even for a member of the Astrea family, a strike from the Star Rod seemed to have taken its toll.

Heinkel, appearing to be in more pain than ever before, was approached by Yae for a quick check on his condition. At the same time, she shot Aldebaran a look that clearly suggested they should take this chance to leave him behind.

Ignoring Yae’s gaze with deliberate indifference, Aldebaran had turned his attention northwest.

Aldebaran: [――――]

Driven by smoke, forced south through the forest, the battle had begun with them being relentlessly pursued.

While steadily whittling down the five hundred enemies in their path, Aldebaran and his group had finally made their way back.

And upon returning――,

???: [――Well now, strange as it is, I don’t feel like I’m seeing you for the first time, helmet knave.]

Aldebaran: [Same here. Maybe it’s ‘cause I’ve been thinking about you this whole time.]

At last, in the very plains where the chase had begun, Aldebaran stood face to face with his true enemy―― Valga Cromwell, after twenty-nine thousand, two hundred and twenty-one attempts.

△▼△▼△▼△

Sat cross-legged upon the needlessly spacious plain, Valga Cromwell rested his chin in his hands.

Looking at him once again, he was huge. Even though he was sitting, the fact that his head was still level with Aldebaran’s, was simply because his body was so big, and perhaps because his legs were short.

Aldebaran: [I can relate. I’ve also got a complex about my legs being short.]

Valga: [I’ll say this now, but I’ve never made a fuss ‘bout the length of my legs. Tho’ back in my hay day, I used ta wish I had a bigger body or longer arms.]

Aldebaran: [You seem young enough even now, gramps, how old are you?]

Valga: [Who knows? I stopped countin’ after a hundred.]

Valga gave a cold answer, but as expected, giants had quite a long lifespan.

Excluding the elves who were said to live forever unless killed, the longest lived race in this world were probably the giants. Considering that those giants were now on the brink of extinction due to having angered a lone Witch, the people of times past must not have known any limits to their rage.

Aldebaran: [A swordsman who went on a killing spree ‘cause his favorite food was Dragon meat, a Witch who almost wiped out a whole tribe due to being angered by a single member of it, the elves were targeted due to the Witch of Envy, the list goes on.]

Valga: [Ya seem awfully knowledgeable ’bout history for a youngster. Besides, weren’t ya all chummy with the Witch of Envy?]

Aldebaran: [Chummy? Well there’s an unfunny joke.]

In their tit for tat, Valga’s voice was obvious in its intent to agitate him, however Aldebaran could not go without refuting it.

Something like getting along with the Witch of Envy, even if that evaluation was sarcastic or in jest, he would not let it slide.

Aldebaran: [That one detests me to an extreme extent. Not once have our eyes ever met.]

Valga: […Eye contact with the Witch of Envy, hm? That in itself’s gotta be an unfunny joke, eh?]

Aldebaran: [If you’re not laughing, neither am I. Every step along the way, you’ve taken the sorta measures I hate the most… where’s lil’ miss Felt?]

Valga: [Capturin’ that girl’d be the quickest way for ya ta end this, ain’t that right? Ya think I’d put her somewhere within yer reach?]

Aldebaran clicked his tongue at that response, and Valga snorted his nose as he gazed behind him―― to the forest where a fierce battle had been unfolding until now, he continued with “And so”.

Valga: [So ya dared ta kill five hundred people, huh?]

Aldebaran: [Though, you might think it’s cute compared to your kill count during the civil war. Besides… ahh, nah, I’ll keep it to myself. It doesn’t matter.]

Valga: [――――]

This too was a tit for tat, so he forced himself to swallow the words he had begun to say. ――In this battle, Aldebaran’s party have not robbed a single person of their life.

In order to weaken their fighting strength, he had gone as far as to give them grievous wounds that put them on the verge of death, but none of their lives would be in danger if they received the proper treatment. 

But, mentioning that here would not have a good influence on Valga’s impression.

It would only prompt skepticism of why he had taken such measures, such unnatural conduct.

Naturally, as Yae had proposed several times, rather than adhering to non-lethality, there had been several points at which taking their opponent’s lives would have made surmounting them easier. Even if the order of magnitude of his attempts thus increased, Aldebaran stubbornly kept to that restriction.

He had made up his mind. Aldebaran had.

From the world she had loved, not a single person more would be lost in the scope of his interference. Save for the one exception, of Natsuki Subaru.

For that reason, Aldebaran would not take the lives of any――,

Valga: [――Yer no longer able ta bear the sight of anybody losin’ their life before yer eyes, ain’t that right?]

――.

――――.

――――――――.

――――――――――――Ah?

Aldebaran: [――Ah?]

Valga: [I had my suspicions. Was when I’d heard that Ezzo n’ Flam got done in at the Pleiades Watchtower, but their lives hadn’t been taken.]

Aldebaran: [Oi…]

Valga: [Flam used the Divine Protection of Mindspeak, ‘n receivin’ the news, the Sword Saint went ta intercept ya at the Augria Sand Dunes where he’s the weakest… that in itself’s a stratagem I could understand, but it was no reason ta let Ezzo live. Once Flam used her Divine Protection, too, she’d have served her purpose, yeah?]

Aldebaran: [Oi, gramps… old geezer…]

Valga: [Any worries that might crop up in the future oughta be eradicated. Ya didn’t take those natural measures. ――If I recall, ya asked me where Felt’s gone off ta. That girl, I had her follow yer escape path. Thus…]

Ignoring Aldebaran’s trembling voice, Valga raised his arm―― a gauntlet fitted with Conversation Mirrors, and tapped the single one that did not have its lid down.

Aldebaran’s party had shattered a total of twelve mirrors now, and that fitted in his gauntlet was the thirteenth and final one. On the other side of that Conversation Mirror, Felt was present.

Valga: [The fact that ya guys ain’t takin’ lives, n’ that there’s no shortage of people who’ll still be able ta move once their restraints are removed. Even if five hundred’s impossible, do ya think ya still have enough strength ta take on more than a hundred again?]

Aldebaran: [You, old geezer…!]

Valga flashed a smile as he spoke, and inside Aldebaran’s helmet, a vein bulged on his forehead.

The fact that Valga turned this side’s restriction on killing against them, having vigilantly progressed arrangements for returning those who had been neutralized to the frontlines, was a surprise.

However, it was not as though Aldebaran’s party had not considered anything. Not only had they tied them up, but they had also broken their limbs, making it difficult for them to return to the battlefield――,

Valga: [For when push comes ta shove, we’ve provided enough Hexcel for everyone. Next won’t be a battle against those who don’t fear pain, but a battle against those who can’t feel pain.]

Aldebaran: [――Hk, ahh, bring it on! Be it a hundred or two hundred they’re welcome to come at me. I’ll just do it all over―]

Again; it was when he was about to shout out in the spur of the moment.

Watching Aldebaran as he raised his voice in anger, Valga abruptly narrowed his eyes. The gaze seemed as if it was looking right into his helmet, and Aldebaran’s breath involuntarily caught.

Thereupon, Valga closed in with words.

Valga: [I see. ――Seems like this conversation’s a first for ya.]

Aldebaran: [――――]

For a moment, not understanding what that signified, Aldebaran tensed up.

But, it was only for a moment. A terrible chill immediately crawled up his back, and Aldebaran finally defined the being before his eyes to be a threat on a greater level than the Sword Saint.

Aldebaran: [YAE――!!]

Instantly, Aldebaran used his voice to the fullest to command Yae, who he had kept on standby, to attack.

Through Yae’s Steel Thread Technique, Valga Cromwell would be restrained; there was no choice but to shut his mouth, which had the potential to speak those thoughts of his. The quickest way to achieve that would be to take his life. However, that would not be done.

Decidedly, he was doing that with his own intentions, not for any reasons like the one Valga had described.

Aldebaran: [So that you don’t wake up for six days, I’ll put you to sleep.]

He had yet to come up with a specific method, but doing that would be the best strategy.

In order to do that, he ordered Yae to move――,

???: [――There you are.]

As if from a stew that simmered a multitude of poisons, a man’s out-of-place voice hung in the air like a malicious fragrance. 

The man had been hiding in the grass of the plain―― with an unsightly appearance consisting of tattoos of balance scales inked all over his body, he directed his gaze to a spot in the forest, and wriggled his bizarrely large right eye.

With a crookedness as if he had forced in an eyeball that did not belong to him, that gaze of his pierced Yae, who had jumped out in an effort to obey Aldebaran’s command.

The covertness of a shinobi had been seen through by that man―― likely Manfred of the Balance.

Then, Manfred placed his palm over his right hand, and capturing Yae in the gaze of his left eyeball that did not match in size,

Manfred: [Don’t move.]

Yae: [――Hk.]

As soon as the command was given, a slight disturbance was born in Yae’s movements.

Interfering with others through the weight of one’s words was the effect of the Divine Protection of Coercion. However, if it was the Divine Protection of Farsight that had pinpointed Yae’s position, this was two unique Divine Protections at the same time.

Aldebaran: [An Apostle of Typhon, are you…!?]

Aldebaran gnashed his teeth, however, Yae overcame the Divine Protection’s power of compulsion in an instant.

She regained composure with the step following the disturbed one, and with a shinobi’s mobility she attempted to extend a thread out towards Valga. ――However, the transcendent would intervene on that disturbed step.

???: [――Vengeance for Flam.]

Having hidden in the grass as Manfred had, Grassis leapt up, and drove a kick into Yae’s torso. Yae promptly crossed an arm over to catch it, but the strike from the girl who had mastered the Flow Method at her young age was frighteningly weighty, sending Yae’s slender body a great deal back.

Yae: [Though, I’ve got nothing to do with your big sis!]

Grassis: [Mostly all of you, are vengeance for Flam.]

Receiving Grassis’s loose retribution, Yae’s hand was instantly broken.

Left in the forest by Yae, Heinkel had yet to get back up after getting hit by the Star Staff earlier, and even if he had gotten back up, he could not count on him in this situation.

That was to say――,

Aldebaran: [――Territory, re-expansion. Matrix redefinition.]

From this point on, Aldebaran would shut the mouth of Valga Cromwell with naught more than his own strength.

For that purpose――,

Valga: [――Ya lost yer cool. No matter the era, that’s always the cause of defeat for the losin’ side.]

Exercising his Authority, the moment he bent the world to his own rules, Aldebaran realized that before his eyes, Valga was chewing something up in his mouth.

Since he also had a habit of gulping down the poison stored behind his molar, he could tell. ――And in this situation, there was only one thing that Valga could be dosing on.

Aldebaran: [Hexcel.]

In an instant, an enormous palm spread out in front of Aldebaran, and he immediately bent backwards.

He fell on his backside. In exchange, the physique of the risen giant seemed to have enlarged even further from the effects of the contraband drug he had taken, and Aldebaran’s breath caught.

Valga Cromwell’s direct combat ability, was unknown to Aldebaran.

However, Valga’s drive in this moment was no less than that of the numerous warriors he had come to face until this point, and in him dwelled a dreadfulness only found in those who staked their lives on the line. 

It happened at the moment in which that drive had overwhelmed him.

???: [――ALDEBARAN!!]

The shout of a man whom he had harbored no expectations of contributing whatsoever, was pointing to the sky.

Aldebaran had also caught a glimpse of him in the corner of his eye, but for Heinkel to point at the sky with a sense of urgency rather than terror or fear in this situation, there was but one reason.

From beyond the sky, the time limit that would bring this battle to an end was coming.

Aldebaran: [With this――]

Valga: [――Time’s up.]

As Aldebaran’s words were convinced of the demise of this hectic situation, they overlapped with Valga’s voice. But, something was strange. In that voice, not a shred of resignation or irritation was present.

On the contrary, it seemed as if Valga had been looking forward to this moment.

――It happened in the subsequent instant. The light that had illuminated the sky on Valga’s command, now flashed anew.

△▼△▼△▼△

――At that moment, as Rom-jii crushed the Magic Stone bringing about the Night Banisher within his hand, his body invigorated via his Hexcel-boosted Gate, he played his final move for the purpose of felling the helmet bastard.

Rom: [The helmet bastard’s behaviour, be it mind reading or precognition, doesn’t make a lick of sense.]

The possibility of his mind being read, and this stratagem thus being countered, was eliminated.

In that case, consideration then fell upon him predicting the future and evading accordingly; but that too would be a tad incoherent.

The future was something that existed only once innumerable choices were added up, naught more, naught less. Moreover, it was not just the choices made by any single person, but the countless choices performed by countless people; the future could not be said to be decided by anything else.

Infeasible it was, to peruse the future, to respond to it perfectly, it was all somewhat lacking in realism. To begin with, even supposing he could witness the future, the positioning of the mirror-bearers would be unknown to him.

But, if he had witnessed results even once, it was a different story.
If the helmet bastard’s Authority was not one of looking forward into the future ahead, but rather one of observing outcomes that had come to pass in the future, then his conduct up till this point stood to reason.

He would inspect pockets in order to identify those designated to be mirror-bearers. He would validate its resulting outcome, and go on to the next. Supposing he had repeated this, the actions of the helmet bastard up till this point, and their results, stood to reason.

Rom: [What in tarnation’s that s’posed to be!?!?]

Because it made logical sense, Rom-jii had become incensed, thinking “That don’t make a lick of gosh darn sense!”.

Mind-reading and precognition were both illogical, but returning after witnessing results―― what to call it eluded him, but whatever the case, it was a rule-breaking ability. Just how could it be thwarted?

Rom: [But, it’s got holes.]

In the first place, were he to possess the almighty ability to observe and respond appropriately to every possible circumstance, the helmet bastard would have been able to even avoid encountering them at this juncture.

This individual had prepared countermeasures for Reinhard, and had succeeded in entrapping him. But compared to meeting him head-on, it would have been much safer to evade him.

As to why he had not done so, was the reason of why he could not do so.

――To witness the outcomes and do things over, he did not have that much time.

And thus, were the usage of the Authority entirely up to the helmet bastard, supposing a lull between danger and safety arose, he would naturally wish to create an area of safety in that opening. ――And therein would the trap be set.

From a position that the helmet bastard was made to believe was a safe zone, all he needed to do was fashion an inescapable crucible of traps.

Thereupon, the final aspect of the trap he had concocted was――,

Rom: [――I’ve summoned back the Divine Dragon, yer ally.]

Helmet Bastard: [――――]

The moment its presence was sighted outwith the sky, the helmet bastard’s faction and naturally the Felt Camp alike were convinced that it signified the battle’s denouement.

At the end of day, the absence of anybody possessing overwhelming power was the primary factor in this battle coming into being.

Were the Divine Dragon to be returned, and were it to lay devastation upon the plains with a single one of its breaths, be there five-hundred or be there a thousand ruffians hardened in their resolve, they would not hold a candle to it.

And as to demonstrate this, the Divine Dragon would unleash a single attack that would cause all fighting spirit to be lost. ――This, unmistakably, was a breath serving as a closing ceremony to the battle, one that would be let loose no matter what.

And that breath would be made to be fired in err, unto a situation in which it could not be evaded.

Rom: [――The Night Banisher’s effect’s ta fake night into lookin’ like daytime. By extension, it’s a deceptive veil that shrouds the true landscape.]

Normally, aiming a Night Banishing Magic Stone in the desired direction would be a difficult affair without being a skilled magician, but Rom-jii, having strained his Gate via Hexcel, had been able to bring that about.
But for what reason had he done so? ――Because this was originally one of the stratagems not carried out during the Demi-Human War.

――Targeting an entity that the Royal Army could not disregard, a great magic would be fired to wipe out all the enemies gathered around said being; a variant of a strategy performed in exchange for a life.

Rom: [Back then, the plan was ta target someone ‘n aim magic at their location. But today’s different.]

The deception produced by the Night Banisher extended, with Rom-jii and the helmet bastard in it enveloped.

――Consequently, Volcanica the Divine Dragon, inborne from heavens faraway, the Dragon tasked with terminating this bout, would without doubt lay eyes upon a sprawling plain bereft of people.

Rom-jii and the helmet bastard’s presence there would go unnoticed by the Dragon, thus causing it to attack erroneously.

Having the Dragon fire its breath at a place it thought no one was present in, was Rom-jii’s―― was Valga Cromwell’s method of nullifying the helmet bastard’s safe zone.

Helmet Bastard: [――Hk.]

Instantly the helmet bastard attempted to escape, yet his leg was seized by Valga Cromwell’s grip.

Realizing that escape was impossible, the helmeted man gulped, and gazed up at the heavens. The Divine Dragon’s eyes were unable to see him. Its mouth came suffused with white light, a breath was released directed at the “desolated” plains.

Rom: [――Felt.]

At that moment, within Valga Cromwell’s―― Nay, within Rom-jii’s mind flashed the figure of his beloved grandchild.

Her time as an infant, her time as a toddler, the woman she now was, all went by in a single instant; wondering if this was the scenery he would get to behold just before his passing, an out of place smile arose upon Rom-jii’s visage.

So much so in fact, that even though anger and loathing were supposed to have filled this pointlessly gargantuan body of his, the faces of Libre and Sphinx, who had skirted death alongside him, flickered not in his conscious. 

Bearing those powerful emotions at his terminus, Rom-jii and the helmet bastard both were engulfed by the Dragon’s breath――,

???: [――Cut it with the crap!!]

In that instant, starlight darted past, smashing through the side of the airborne Dragon’s maw, and the breath that was to be sicced loose veered off towards a different direction, exploding upon a plain that was verily desolate.

Rom: [Wha…]

Jostled about by the humongous plume of smoke and the shockwave, Rom-jii was unable to hold firm, and tumbled over. Dragged by the former’s fall, the helmet bastard likewise raised a cry of pain of “GWOAHH!”.

Had it gone entirely as his own self had anticipated, the unthinkable might of the Dragon’s breath would have, without a doubt, finally driven the helmet bastard into a situation with no escape, leaving him defeated.

And yet――,

???: [I had a bad feeling and this is what I find. Being prepared to die and wanting to die right away are two totally different things, you know! Big stupid Rom-jii!!]

The one to roar thus, having smashed Valga Cromwell’s stratagem into smithereens, their red eyes reddened a degree further whilst bearing tears, Star Staff in hand, was his adorable grandchild.

――By his own adorable grandchild, Valga Cromwell had been defeated.
