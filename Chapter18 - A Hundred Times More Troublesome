*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――They recounted their lonely struggles, their days of ineradicable remorse.

A tale pertaining to their past, one that they had decided ought not be treated without the utmost respect, gravity, and caution.
 
Even after letting it all out, their never-let-go and forward-facing mindset was ephemeral.

???: [My compensation, that is.]

They could not help but detest the Witch who expressed the price for leaving this dream world as thus.
 
With a trace of their red tongue, with a hint of mischief hanging in the air, that vacuous beauty toyed with them, seemingly scheming to guide them as per their will.

Witch: [Alright, I’ve decided.]

The first time, she had demanded that they forget, but what would she decree for this second time?
 
As if to mock them, as they involuntarily stiffened, the Witch, who exuded the faint fragrance of flowers, brought her fingers to a white handkerchief that fluttered in the wind.

――It was embroidered with a Great Spirit in the form of a gray cat, with gold linings around the white fabric.

???: [The handkerchief Petra gave me when I left for the Sanctuary…?]

To scream out “Stop” until their throat was hoarse, they wished.
 
To scream out “Stop” at the top of their lungs, they could not find their throat.

To throw themselves in front of the repulsive Witch with a “Stop”, they wished.
 
To stand before the repulsive Witch with a “Stop”, none were present.

Ergo, no matter how much they attempted to shout “Stop, stop it!” in their heart, no matter how much their soul attempted to step in, they could not stop them.

Witch: [The price for the tea party has been paid. From the bottom of my heart, I look forward to your next visit.]

The value of the payment was expressed, and a sense of relief and a slight sense of happiness grew.
 
More than feeling triumphant that they had been the one to have led to that, they ere far, far, far, far more terrified that the Witch had taken an interest in them.
 
Just what their own self had become a part of, they knew not.

???: [Looks like Echidna kept her word. The tea party didn’t get erased from my memories this time.]

The dream world was ended by a white light, and they returned from the illusion to a dark, cold space.
 
Returning to the location where they again had met the Witch―― something odd, they noticed.

???: […Where’s Emilia?]

Their heart growing restless by her absence when she ought to have been present, they were filled with a sense of unease.

An overflowing sense of anxiety and a sense of incongruity seemed to seep out, as for one who had been forced to repeat this over and over again, it was a deviation from a base principle, a deviation that should not exist.

Driven by a sense of foreboding welling up from within, they hurriedly left the Tomb.
 
And as soon as they stepped outside the Tomb and into the moonlight, what they saw was――,

???: [A shadow…?]

The Sanctuary, shrouded in the darkest of blacks, a tonality mark of a Witch even more terrifying than the Witch who had created said place.

No matter how much they shouted “Stop!”, how much they rejected it, how much they cried, how much they resisted, it would not draw to a close.
 
Certain it was, assuredly it was the history of an unerasable path of his.

――In all of this, what part did I play?

△▼△▼△▼△

――"Helmet bastard", the voice exclaimed, clearly recognizing Aldebaran.
Yae had sensed the presence of an ambush, and a familiar, authoritative voice called out. It was not necessary to think very hard in order to realize that the deliberate all-out diversionary move that separated them from their main force had ended up in failure.

With that realization in mind, the problem currently facing Aldebaran was――,

???: [Hey! That voice just now was that blonde brat! It’s Reinhard’s master! Why is she in a place like this… wasn’t it supposed to be impossible to find us here!?]

A distraught Heinkel, who seemed to be taken aback, carefully described the confusion of the entire situation.

His level of panic was the same as Aldebaran’s inner thoughts, but his earlier, shameful fuss helped Aldebaran to avoid becoming distracted himself.

Nevertheless, the situation was still far from being bright.

Aldebaran: […The matrix got updated fifteen seconds ago.]

The regular updating of the matrix was intended as a prudent measure in the event of a surprise attack in order to avoid unnecessary risk, but it appeared to have backfired in this case.

Aldebaran could only go back fifteen seconds from this set point if he wanted to try again.

This meant that the oncoming ambush was inevitable. ――An ambush like this was a far worse thing for Aldebaran to face than any surprise attack.

Whether it was due to his own good judgment or just by intuition, he set it at precisely the wrong moment.

Yae: [If you’re talking about the master of the Sword Saint, could this be the rumored Felt-sama~? …Guess it’s already time to use Heinkel-sama as a human sacrifice~, huh?]

Heinkel: [――Hk, if you’re trying to get through this by using me as a hostage, it’ll get you nowhere! Getting Reinhard to inherit the headship of the Astrea family is what they want. Right now, I'm in a bad position because I'm with you guys… if they have a good enough reason, they’ll kill me mercilessly!]

Yae: [We~ll… if that’s the case, then wouldn’t that make you even more suited for the role of human sacrifice?]

Heinkel: [This ain’t any time to be joking!]

Perhaps she may not have been joking. Heinkel yelled back at her with a dumbfounded look in his eyes as Yae asked, “What should we do~?”, and shrugged at Aldebaran.

Unlike the two distraught, shaken up middle-aged men, Yae calmly accepted the situation that they faced. Perhaps being the result of her shinobi training, her well-honed mental strength was admirable. 

For Aldebaran, he could never reach that level even if he died a million times――,

Aldebaran: [In any case, it won’t do us any good to sacrifice the old man.]

If it really was Felt and the others waiting for them outside the forest, then as he had sadly realized that Heinkel would have been ineffective as a hostage. In fact, it would have made for quite the punchline if “Here lies the beloved Heinkel Astrea” was engraved on his tombstone in the event that he lost his life.

And, the reason why only pessimistic pictures came to mind was because they lacked the materials to paint an optimistic picture.

Aldebaran: [Yae, old man, wait here. I’ll go take a look first.]

Heinkel: [Wh… are you out of your mind!? This woman’s a shinobi, isn’t she? Why not send her first in case anything goes wrong!? You should be thinking the same!]

Yae: [――. Al-sama, is this the best course of action?]

Aldebaran: [Yeah.]

He gave that answer while pulling in his chin, and Yae readily withdrew, saying, “Yes si~r.” Heinkel, his face still red with frustration, tried to continue pressing the issue, but,

Yae: [Cut it out, Heinkel-sama. There’s no need to worry, who else could come up with an idea like using the Divine Dragon Volcanica and actually pull it off? There’s no way he doesn’t have a plan.]

Heinkel: [Well, I… I, guess so…]

Heinkel reluctantly retracted his words in response to Yae's covering fire.

As one would have expected, the prestige of the Divine Dragon was effective in many ways, regardless of whether or not the being in question was senile. Even in this situation where they were completely outdone, it gave one confidence that Aldebaran would not just take it lying down.

Unfortunately, their lack of planning was glaringly obvious, and things were sadly not as Yae had said.

Aldebaran: [Now, am I walking into an Oni nest or a snake pit?]

He felt uneasy either way, but he hid those uneasy thoughts inside his helmet and headed straight out of the forest, leaving the other two behind.

The information he needed to gather included the identity of their opponents as well as their strength――,

???: [――Huh? You sure seem prepared, coming out so boldly like that, don’t you?]

The view, obscured by tall trees, suddenly cleared, revealing a plain spreading out before Aldebaran’s eyes.

Standing majestically on the other side of the plain with a smile that bared her white canines was a girl with golden hair and red eyes; it was the person he had assumed judging from the characteristics of her voice and the content of her conversation―― Felt.

Aldebaran: [――――]

This was what followed the encounter with Reinhard. That in itself was no surprise.

In addition, Aldebaran had already begun estimating his opponent's strength as soon as he guessed that the opponent was Felt. ――By that point, the two biggest names of the camp, the Sword Saint and the Gray, had already been dealt with.

Referring back to his knowledge he acquired from his time in the Watergate City of Pristella, the other key members of the camp were the trio of former thugs, Flam's yet-to-be-met younger sister, and the old giant who invaded the royal castle. Although Felt's own abilities were yet to be confirmed, it was unlikely that she would come close to matching Priscilla's strength.

But even Priscilla would have been no match for Aldebaran if they were to fight one-on-one.

Even in the unlikely event that Felt turned out to have some kind of secret hidden power, there would have been no problem in dealing with her. ――At least, that was what Aldebaran had thought as he left the forest.

However――,

Aldebaran: […Hey hey, what kinda joke is this?]

Aldebaran could not help but give a dry smile at the unexpected sight that unfolded before his eyes.

After all, the original prediction for the size of the group was only five or six people at most. However, this was roughly a hundred times the size of that―― a group of over five hundred people were there to give a welcome to Aldebaran.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Felt had grown up in the slums, and even though her position in society had changed, she still had a side of her that had not changed from when she was in poverty.

Although she no longer lacked food, clothing, or a place to stay, those things were not of Felt's own possession; they were all attached to Reinhard and the Astrea household.

Reinhard was Felt's Knight, but she was not so deluded as to think that this gave her the right to all of his possessions.

Therefore, she had no intention of letting the original “cards” that made up her hand rot, even if the food she ate was delicious, the quality of her clothes changed dramatically, and she could sleep soundly until morning.

The “cards” in Felt’s hand were, simply put, a collection of traits she had cultivated in order to be able to "live strong."

Her keen eye for spotting easy pickings and her ability to run away, both honed during her time in the slums, her courage in the face of any situation, and her intuition for when she was in a bind―― all of these had been sharpened further after the incident with the Bowel Hunter that led to her encounter with Reinhard, and she continued to hone these skills even during her time spent receiving a higher education in preparation for the Royal Selection.

As a matter of fact, all of these "cards" were now much more useful than before. ――And yet, she had still never been able to shake off Reinhard even once.

In any case, by continuing to hone her old "cards," Felt's perspective had broadened to a level that allowed her to see things that she could not have seen before.

Felt’s newfound pride did not allow her to overlook the slightest sense of unease that may have been bothering her.

――The same applied to when Flam, who had been left behind at the Pleiades Watchtower, sent word of the critical situation to her twin sister Grassis in the Royal Capital via the Divine Protection of Telepathy.

???: [――Felt-sama, I will hasten towards the Augria Sand Dunes at once. I may have to do battle against the Divine Dragon Volcanica there. If the battle reached outside the Sand Sea, the damage would be far too great.] 

Felt: [Wait a second… It almost seems like they’re goin’ out of their way to start the battle in that sandy dump to me. I’m pretty sure you were sayin’ something about how that place is where you’re at your weakest in the whole world, yeah?]

Reinhard: [――. Yes, that is true. I am not very compatible with the Miasma in that location. However, avoiding this is not an option. Flam and Ezzo-dono are in the Tower. In addition…]

Upon hearing the news from Grassis, Reinhard seemed to be filled with a sense of duty as the Sword Saint, to which Felt responded by saying “I know” and scratching her head.

The face that Reinhard was making at that moment was not one that Felt was particularly fond of, but there was no point in bringing it up. More importantly, she needed to get Reinhard to accept her next proposal.

That proposal was――,

Felt: [Reinhard, I ain’t tellin’ you not to go. But, don’t just go off on your own. ――Take us part of the way too.]

Reinhard: [Felt-sama, that is…!]

Felt: [Hey, are you sayin’ that you’re goin’ off to do something reckless but won’t let me help? Stop bein’ so conceited. Aside from you, everyone else is still entitled to do everything they can.]

Reinhard: [――――]

Reinhard remained silent, unsure of what to say in defense, and it was easy to understand what was going on inside his mind from a glance.

After all, not only had his opponent completely defeated Ezzo and Flam, but he also had the Divine Dragon Volcanica with him. This could potentially have been one of the biggest crises the kingdom had ever faced.

It was truly a colossal task worthy of the attention of the Sword Saint.

Felt: [I don’t get it, though.]

Reinhard: [May I ask what you do not understand?]

Felt: [Even if he didn’t know about Flam’s Divine Protection, people would still find out about him as soon as he brought out the Divine Dragon. Seein’ him flyin’ around like that would make it obvious. But still, that helmet bastard did it anyway.]

Reinhard: […So, are you saying that Al-dono is acting in anticipation of that, Felt-sama?]

Felt: [Which is more likely in his case: anticipatin’ that people will come, or believin’ that nobody will come for him?]

Felt asked this with one eye closed, and Reinhard began to seriously consider the possibility.

He must have had some sort of measure in place to deal with Reinhard. In fact, it was quite possible that bringing the Divine Dragon to his side was a part of it.

With the poor conditions of being in the Augria Sand Dunes and the presence of the Divine Dragon, was it still possible for Reinhard to overcome this?

Reinhard: [Even if that is the case… Even so, I must go. Even if the enemy has taken effective countermeasures, I am the only one who can overcome them…]

Felt: [――Reinhard, don’t worry.]

When she gave her order to Reinhard, the eyes of the red-haired Knight widened in surprise as he knelt before her. When he did not move as instructed, Felt placed both of her hands on his cheeks.

Reinhard’s eyes were fixed on her, sullying his beautiful appearance which had earlier caused such excitement in the streets.

Felt: [Moron, I told you I ain’t stoppin’. When someone offers you something, you should take it. Unleash your ridiculous strength and go wild. ――I’ll pick up the rest from there.]

Reinhard: [――Ah.]

She said this with their faces close enough that their noses were almost touching, and just as she was watching his sky-blue eyes shimmer with surprise, the door to the room was violently slammed open. 

Standing there were a group of familiar faces, gasping for breath――,

Felt: [You’ve come back just in time. How’d it go?]

???: [Haa, haa… t-this is just insane…]

???: [Why don’t we just use one of our own sturdy dragon carriages that we don’t care about breaking, milady!?]

???: [You idiot, that ground dragon… Romy, I thought we couldn’t take it with us. What the hell is going on? Grassis didn’t give me any details either.]

???: [Dragon carriage procurement, complete.]

The trio squeezed through the cramped entrance, shoulder to shoulder, with a sleepy-eyed Grassis following behind them.

Reinhard looked around at the crowd of people who had just arrived, and again his eyes widened in surprise. Felt snorted at the sight of the face that looked a little younger than its age,

Felt: [Hey, put a little more life into your face.]

Reinhard: [Felt-sama, this is…]

Felt: [Don't get ahead of yourself and start thinkin’ you can do everything on your own, Reinhard. You can’t even hold hands with all three of them at once by yourself.]

She had said that while shrugging her shoulders at him, and Reinhard blinked, his eyes fixated on her. Then he took a deep breath, and quietly let the emotion in his eyes slowly begin to settle,

Reinhard: [――Yes. I am a Sword Saint who cannot even hold hands with all three of them at once.]

Finally, he nodded, donning the face of Reinhard, not just that of the Sword Saint.

△▼△▼△▼△

After that it was a race against time, as Felt worked Reinhard as hard as possible.

Carrying the dragon carriage that Grassis and the others had found, Reinhard went from the Royal Capital to the Augria Sand Dunes in a single flight, sending them to the Astrea domain en route.

Reinhard: [I am leaving now, Felt-sama!]

Felt: [Go make some noise and beat em’ up!]

Truthfully, even with Reinhard’s Divine Protection of Wind Evasion, she would not want to experience this emergency trip again, but it was undoubtedly worthwhile to make the detour.

The helmet bastard’s counters against Reinhard, their viciousness had far exceeded her wildest imaginations.

——The manifestation of the Witch of Envy in the Sand Dunes, which she knew was still keeping Reinhard at a standstill, had occurred shortly after his departure.

???: [To think, the Witch of Envy... even in my prime, I wouldn’t have trained in such a method. That helmet knave, I don't know him, but was he really that crazy?]

Rom-jii, who was stroking his bald head with his large palm, sighed heavily at the distant report.

Rom-jii, who had joined them at the estate, was one of the two main strategists of the faction, along with Ezzo, who was no longer present. However, upon hearing Rom-jii’s report, Felt shook her head in disagreement.

Felt: [From what I saw, that helmet bastard wasn’t that crazy. His appearance and way of speaking were different, sure, but honestly, he was no worse than that cat-eared from Crusch nee-chan’s side or the black-haired nii-chan from Emilia nee-chan’s side.]

This situation, caused by Al who had turned into an enemy, did not leave a particularly good or bad impression on Felt. ——However, like the other knights, she thought he had a strong sense of loyalty to his master, despite his frivolous attitude.

That was why——,

Felt: [——when that princess died, he just went and threw everything away, huh?]

——The death of Priscilla Barielle, caught in the internal struggle of the Vollachian Empire.

The unbelievable news delivered to the Royal Castle of Lugunica naturally reached Felt’s ears while she was in the Royal Capital.

To be honest, she couldn’t understand it right away when she heard it, and even now, she doesn’t feel it in any real sense.

That’s how full of life Priscilla was, so far removed from anything related to death.

Felt: […There’s no such thing as an immortal human. Us bystanders can swallow it like that. But that helmet bastard wasn’t like that.]

Rom: [But, if that’s the case, what’s his plan? According to the report from Flam, he’s said to be commanding a Divine Dragon, but is he planning a grand suicide, dragging the world into it?]

Felt: [I don’t think that’s the case, though…]

To throw everything away, dragging the world with him to mourn Priscilla’s death. ——Felt thought it was unlikely to be such an outburst in that direction.

If Al’s goal was such an obvious desire for destruction, then the biggest obstacle to that would undoubtedly be Reinhard.

???: [Yet, the helmet bastard didn't team up with the Witch… the Witch of Envy to kill Reinhard. So, for now, it means world destruction isn't his goal.]

Felt: [Oh, what’s this, Rachins? Just because Sensei isn’t here, you’re trying to be the voice of reason?]

Rachins: [Don’t mock me. Honestly, if you ask me, I just want to escape and run. The Witch of Envy showing up? This is beyond what we can handle.]

Exaggeratedly flicking his long tongue, Rachins snapped at Felt.

Beside him were Gaston and Camberley, who both anxiously agreed with Rachins, saying, “Yeah, yeah”,

???: [Y-Yeah, that’s right, miss! Even if Reinhard stopped the Witch of Envy, the Divine Dragon is still running wild, right? That’s beyond what we can handle!]

???: [Felt understands that much, right? Returning to the territory is to evacuate the citizens just in case…]

Felt: [Yeah, we’ll need to deal with that too——]

???: [See? I said it… wait, did I say that?]

For a moment, Gaston's eyes twinkled with relief at Felt's response. Seeing his reaction, Felt laughed and nodded, saying, “Oh, you did, you did”,

Felt: [We have to think about the worst-case scenario, but we can’t make a huge fuss. After all, you guys are freaking out just because it’s a Witch.]

???: [Of course, we are! And you’re freaking out, too, aren’t you?! It’s a Witch, a Witch!]

Felt: [Your girlfriend gets called something similar, doesn't she?]

???: [Toto gets called “Wicked Temptress” but she’s cute in front of me, so it’s fine!]

Rachins: [Stop fooling around! The conversation’s getting off track!]

Interrupting the spitting match between Felt and Camberley, Rachins sharply glared at them as he said, “Okay?” and placed his hand on the map spread out on the tabletop with a thump.

Rachins: [We won’t get anywhere unless we decide on a course of action. Felt, what’s your plan?]

Camberley: [Hah, if it’s by majority vote, there’s no doubt the answer is to run. But…]

Rom: [——We all intend to follow your lead.]

Seeing Rom’s serious tone, Felt briefly held her breath.

Looking around, Rachins had a skeptical look, Gaston’s face was grim, and Camberley’s legs trembled like a newborn deer, all waiting for Felt's response without arguing.

Seriously, when did these guys become so reliable?

Felt: [That’s been me all along. I really hated it when something bad happened, and people just sat around waiting for someone else to fix it.]

Rachins: [Sigh, such a fiery way of thinking. I wonder who she got that from.]

Felt: [Who knows. Ask my foster parent, have them think about it.]

After saying that to her foster parent, who slowly shook his head, Felt stuck her tongue out playfully, then, she turned around with enthusiasm, looking at the group waiting for her words.

And then, she declared.

Felt: [Alright, you guys, get your butts up. The ones who disrespected our Reinhard… don’t hold back, let’s smash them!]

 △▼△▼△▼△

――Resolved to fight, Felt and her people had moved swiftly. 

Far away at the eastern edge of the world, the battle between Reinhard and the Witch of Envy raged on.

And Al, the one who had given rise to such a predicament, had left the battlefield, departing the sand sea with the Divine Dragon in tow―― they had been able to accurately grasp the opponent’s movements until that point.

The problem was――,

???: [There’ve been eyewitness reports that the Divine Dragon’s going north. Take that at face value, and you’d assume the helmet knave’s gotta be operating alongside it… that’s to say, their destination would be in the north, but…]

Felt: [If that’s at face value, you’re saying there’s a thought pattern that branches another way?]

???: [Mm. Far as I’ve heard, the helmet knave’s plans were so meticulous that they included countermeasures for Reinhard. So then, why go out of his way to stand out at the inn town by the exit of the sand dunes?]

Felt: [That’d be, to give us the impression that he’s got a Dragon with him, yeah?]

???: [Indeed, he’d wanted to give us that impression. ――After all, ain’t the Divine Dragon flying at a height such that people can see it headed north with their naked eye?]

Though he had prefaced that it would branch another way, Old Man Rom’s conjecture was certainly unexpected.

Nearly all affairs had a simple way to interpret them, alongside a more twisted way to interpret them, and in the majority of cases, the simplest interpretation would result in the right answer.

However, a faint unease had restrained Felt’s feelings here.

Felt: [Deliberately making a show of the Dragon going north, for what purpose?]

Rom: [Naturally. it’s to conceal his true aims, oughta be. Showing the Dragon flying is a card he played to distract… so aside from the north and east, I presume his destination should lie to the west or south.]

Felt: [――. The Princess died in the Empire. If the Divine Dragon opened fire on the Empire, would it kick off a conflict with that country, which is filled with complex relations…? No, I guess it wouldn’t.]

If that guess was correct, it would certainly yield a great deal of friction between the Kingdom and the Empire.

However, that would be in striking contradiction to the sovereign letter regarding the future of diplomatic relations between the Vollachian Empire and the Kingdom of Lugunica, sent back at the time of the news of Priscilla’s death.

Of course, there was also the possibility that not wanting to get the Kingdom involved, it was a simple act of retaliation towards the Empire.

Felt: [If that were the case, there wouldn’t be much difference to a suicide bombing that engulfs the entire world. That would mean…]

Rom: [――What would it mean?]

Felt: [――My intuition’s telling me west. Though, I can’t tell if it’s straight west, northwest, or southwest.]

Rom: [If the Dragon is a diversion, we can eliminate the possibility of northwest. That narrows it down to two points. All that’s left is to――]

Felt: [Yeah, all that’s left is to――]

――Gambling everything on their interpretation, Felt lined up all of her Camp’s military strength upon the plain.

To put it bluntly, the Astrea Domain did not retain much of an army. This too was a malady of Reinhard being far too strong, but she had tasked those few soldiers with leading the evacuation of the territories that the opponent might pass through.

That was fine. Their strength was meant to protect. Right now, what was necessary was not that, but rather――,

???: [――As I thought, there’s something wrong with you, girl.]

???: [Nah nah nah, I don’t know about that. She’s got a decisiveness that I find desirable. If need there be, ya don’t hesitate to drag us vassals of violence into it. I can hold my nose high as your supporter.] 

???: [And where might that nose of yours be, I wonder? Those tattoos on your face are so vehemently assertive, and my eyes are unable to get a complete view of your facial features whatsoever.]

With each speaking in their own respective manner, those were the representatives of the gathered military strenght.

One was a large pig human clad in a thick armor of muscle, of a huge stature that rivaled Old Man Rom.

One was an eccentric of queer appearance, his face covered in blue tattoos of balancing scales. 

One was a blooming beauty, coquettishly adorned in lascivious clothing unsuited to the situation.

――The Black Silver Coin, the Balance, and the Flower Prison Garden.

Although they were lined up, they showed not a tinge of amicability towards each other, but there was one thing they all had in common. ――That, upon Felt’s beck and call, they had gathered.

They were the big shots that governed over the criminal underworld of the Earth Dragon Capital of Flanders, a city northeast of the Astrea Domain, and since becoming acquainted with them during a previous incident, Felt networked with them.

Each and every one of them were scoundrels with scars on their shins, but at the same time they were a necessary evil who were supporters of Felt―― numbering around five-hundred people in total, they trusted in Felt’s instincts, and had accompanied her to this battle formation.

Felt: [Hah! What a magnificent sight! How did this many end up gathering here?]

Making a visor with her hand, Felt raised her voice at the line-up of five hundred scoundrels.

In truth, when she thought to attempt borrowing strength from Flanders, she estimated that a tenth of this amount would have been satisfactory. Unexpectedly, she had gotten ten times that number.

Felt: [Even though I told him that the opponent was a guy who managed to outmaneuver Reinhard… Geez, I know it’s not the place or time for it, but I wish I could show you.]

It was something she wished she could teach Reinhard, who was not present here.

That there were so many people who, instead of turning their butts and running from a situation Reinhard could not overcome, had gathered to clean up after his ass.

Felt: [Well, there are also probably some like Camberly who just can’t back out.]

Muttering so, Felt cracked her neck, and turned around with her allies to her back.

Ahead of her vision, parallel to the line-up of the troupe, the large forest―― facing it, Felt inhaled in as large of a breath that could fit in her small body,

Felt: [――Oi! You can hear me, can’t you? I know you’re in there, helmet bastard!]

Indeed, she unleashed a declaration of war that served to commence the battle.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Having had absolutely no idea that such an inconceivable move could have been played at all, Aldebaran could do nothing but stand still at the sight spread out before him.

Aldebaran: [Oi oi…]

To the extent that a dry smile unconsciously emerged on his face, this situation completely derailed Aldebaran’s calculations.

A situation a hundred times worse than he could have ever hypothesized, filled him with awe. Truly, this situation filled him with awe.

Lacking a sense of visiual cohesion, the troupe was lined up across the plain, however, firmly sharing in the goal to oppose something, they were an army corps of non-uniform steel.

Aldebaran: [――――]

Still wearing a dry smile on his face, Aldebaran was at a loss.

The way his mind was abruptly thrown into chaos when things outside his expectations occurred, was the fundamentaldifference between himself and Yae, who was impressed by them.

The grounds on which Yae acknowledged him as superior to her, too, was nothing more than a fabrication secured by his cheat technique of an Authority.

In any case――,

Aldebaran: [Quite the big shot, eh, lil’ miss Felt.]

Right in the center of that astonishment, Felt was the key figure who truly went above and beyond Aldebaran’s expectations.

Her atmosphere, which had convinced him so, had grown ever sharper in just the three months that he had not seen her. As expected from the outstanding talent who had made Priscilla recognize her as a worthy enemy in merely a year.

Her level of importance in the world fundamentally differed to that of Aldebaran. ――Having said that, his resolve was not so cheap that he would back down for that reason.

Aldebaran: [Thanks for coming out to greet me. But, is it really fine for you to concern yourself with me? Even now, your guys’ Sword Saint is――]

Felt: [――Sorry dude.]

Aldebaran: [――――]

Aldebaran was going to attempt to try and obtain whatever scraps of information he could for the time being through a battle of words. However, mercilessly interrupting his words, Felt scratched her head as she closed a single eye.

And then――,

Felt: [Both me and Old Man Rom agreed that shutting you up was the first thing we oughta do.]

Aldebaran: [――Hk.]

That instant, Aldebaran’s body tensed up at a dreadful sensation. But, he was too late.

Before he could even react to that sense of dread, a small shadow that had been hiding in the entrance to the woods leapt out, and delivered a strong blow to the back of Aldebaran’s neck with a slender foot.

Aldebaran: [Kah, kuh…]

The intense impact jolted his brain, and Aldebaran’s knees buckle as they lost their strength.

In the corner of his vision, the one who had delivered that blow landed nimbly on the grass, their two bundles of peach hair swaying as they looked at Aldebaran with sleepy eyes.

A countenance he recognized ―― the young girl that bore a striking resemblance to that, her true identity was,

???: [Vengeance for Flam.]

From those brief, matter-of-fact words, he understood that she had to be Flam’s younger sister.

Crumbling down from the girl’s attack, as he lost hold of his consciousness, Aldebaran muttered.

Aldebaran: [I’m, not dead…]

Then, as his consciousness slowly faded down into the abyssal darkness―― completely reflex, he gulped down his poison. 

Taking the deadly poison kept behind his molar, was the singular action that Aldebaran had performed the most in his life, an exquisite skill deeply ingrained not just to his body, but to his soul.

This alone was Aldebaran’s one and only special technique that not even the Sword Saint himself, Reinhard van Astrea, could get in the way of.

After all, there was not a single person in this world better at killing Aldebaran than Aldebaran――,
